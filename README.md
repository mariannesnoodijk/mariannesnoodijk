### About me:

Based in Amsterdam, I'm a former showroom manager now navigating the exciting world of full-stack development. While I have a keen interest in front-end development, I'm also eager to explore the backend. 

Enthusiastic about creating seamless user experiences and always open to learning and collaborating on innovative projects. 

Let's connect and code together! ðŸŒ†ðŸš€
